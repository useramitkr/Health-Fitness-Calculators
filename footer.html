                Calculator.net's sole focus is to provide fast, comprehensive, convenient, free online calculators in a
                plethora of areas.
                Currently, we have around 200 calculators to help you "do the math" quickly in areas such as finance,
                fitness, health, math,
                and others, and we are still developing more. Our goal is to become the one-stop, go-to site for people
                who need to make quick calculations.
                Additionally, we believe the internet should be a source of free information. Therefore, all of our
                tools and services are completely free,
                with no registration required.
            </p>

                We coded and developed each calculator individually and put each one through strict, comprehensive
                testing. However, please inform us
                if you notice even the slightest error – your input is extremely valuable to us. While most calculators
                on Calculator.net are designed
                to be universally applicable for worldwide usage, some are for specific countries only. For example, the
                Income Tax Calculator is for
                United States residents only.
